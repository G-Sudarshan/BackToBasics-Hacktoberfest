# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

It is possible that you come across a potential security vulnerability while going through the project. You will need to file an issue for it. We have created a issue template for vulnerabilities which you can use. If you want to work on fixing it, wait for one of the moderators to assign the issue to you, and then only start working on it. Once you are done, you can submit a PR with the code that has the vulnerability removed
